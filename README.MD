# WIP: Stream Event Schedule Viewer

This is very much a work-in-progress. It currently doesn’t twitch at all!

This extension lets users see upcoming stream event dates/times, as well as descriptions.

## Development

Currently runs as a gatsby site. To start development, follow the below instructions.

1. run `yarn` in your command line to install dependencies
2. To test files live without Twitch, run `yarn develop`.
